# auto_reload_extension
I just wanted to try my hand at making a simple tab auto-reload extension for Chromium. Don't use this over one in an app store, there is no customization. You get one option, right click on a tab and select 'Auto Reload' to reload a tab automatically every 60 seconds. I might do more with this later.
